Whose Headline?
===============

A game of guessing who published the headline.

I wrote this game at the [NYC News+Gaming Hackathon](http://hackshackers.com/blog/2011/04/24/headline-guessing-site-wins-newsgaming-hackathon-in-nyc/). It was based on an [previous idea](https://github.com/aubergene/Headliner) I had worked on whilst at [The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk).

Feel free to improve it and send pull requests.
